/**
 * Retrieves the public key addresses of all token accounts owned by a specified address and associated with a predefined mint.
 *
 * Utilizing Solana's Web3.js API, this function queries for all token accounts owned by the provided public key address (`ownerAddress`).
 * It filters these accounts to include only those associated with a specific mint address (`MINT_ADDRESS`).
 *If no matching token accounts are found, an empty array is returned.

 * @param {string} ownerAddress - The public key address of the owner whose token accounts are being searched.
 * @returns {Promise<string[]>} A promise that resolves to an array of strings, each representing the public key address of a token account owned by the input address and associated with the predefined mint.
 *         If no such accounts exist, the promise resolves to an empty array.
 * @throws {Error} If the function encounters an error during execution, it throws a new error with a message detailing the nature of the error.
